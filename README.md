Java Collection Framework Project
This project demonstrates the usage and implementation of the Java Collection Framework. It provides examples and exercises to help users understand various collection types, interfaces, and their implementations in Java.

Features
Examples of common collection types:
Lists (ArrayList, LinkedList)
Sets (HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet)
Queues (LinkedList, PriorityQueue)
Maps (HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap)
Demonstrations of collection operations:
Adding, removing, and accessing elements
Iterating over collections
Sorting and searching
Custom implementations of collection interfaces (if applicable)
Performance comparisons and use cases
Technologies Used
Java 8 or higher# Collection-framework-practice

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
